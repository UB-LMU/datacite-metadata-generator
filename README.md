datacite-metadata-generator
===========================

This is a single HTML form which can be used to generate DataCite Metadata Kernel 4.3 XML. 

It is the updated version of [Marcin Paluch's](https://github.com/mpaluch/datacite-metadata-generator) metadata generator.
Metadata is generated by populating text boxes and selecting values from drop-downs. The results can then be saved to a file. The main goal of this form was to create a tool which does not require any installation, extra libraries, or an application server, just download and go.

This update was created by [Osman Cakir](https://github.com/osmancakir) from the IT-Group for the Humanities (ITG) at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. The work is part of the project "eHumanities – interdisziplinär" and is mentioned in the [DataCite Best Practice Guide](https://github.com/UB-LMU/DataCite_BestPracticeGuide).
